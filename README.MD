## Foundations First

Before any marketing, get clear on these three essentials:

### 1. Who You Help

Be specific. The narrower, the better for attracting the right people.

| Too Broad | Better | Best |
|-----------|--------|------|
| Anyone who wants coaching | Women feeling stuck | Ambitious women in their 30s navigating career transitions |
| People who want to grow | Professionals seeking balance | Tech professionals burning out and questioning their path |

### 2. The Transformation You Provide

Describe the before and after state your clients experience:

> *"My clients come to me feeling overwhelmed and disconnected from their purpose. They leave with clarity, confidence, and a concrete path forward."*

### 3. Why You

What's your unique angle? This could be:

- Your personal story and what you've overcome
- Your specific methodology or approach
- Your background and how it informs your coaching
- The energy and presence you bring

## Social Media Strategy

### Platform Priority

For coaches launching in 2024-2025:

| Platform | Priority | Best For |
|----------|----------|----------|
| **Instagram** | Primary | Visual storytelling, building community, Reels discovery |
| **LinkedIn** | Secondary | Professional clients, thought leadership, less saturated |
| **TikTok** | Optional | Younger audience, viral potential, requires more content volume |
| **YouTube** | Long-term | Deep trust-building, evergreen content, SEO |

**Recommendation:** Start with Instagram only. Add LinkedIn if your ideal clients are professionals.

---

### Instagram Content Pillars

Rotate between these five content types:

#### 1. Personal Story Posts
Vulnerable shares about your own journey. These build trust and connection.

> *Example: "Three years ago, I was exactly where you are now. Here's what I wish someone had told me..."*

#### 2. Teaching & Value Posts
Short insights, reframes, or mindset shifts. Establish expertise without being preachy.

> *Example: "The question isn't 'What should I do with my life?' It's 'What am I avoiding feeling?'"*

#### 3. Client Transformation Stories
Share results and journeys (with permission). Even anonymized stories work.

> *Example: "When Sarah came to me, she hadn't slept through the night in months. After 8 weeks together..."*

#### 4. Behind-the-Scenes
Your workspace, what you're reading, your own practices. Humanizes your brand.

> *Example: Stories showing your morning routine, a book you're loving, prep for a client session*

#### 5. Direct Offers
Clear posts about what you offer and how to work with you. Many coaches under-do this.

> *Example: "I have 2 spots opening for 1:1 coaching in January. Here's who it's for..."*

### Posting Rhythm

#### Launch Phase (First 8 Weeks)

| Format | Frequency | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| Feed Posts | 4-5 per week | Mix of carousels, single images, Reels |
| Stories | Daily | Even 2-3 frames showing your day, thoughts, questions |
| Reels | 1-2 per week | Short, authentic—doesn't need polish |

#### Maintenance Phase (Ongoing)

| Format | Frequency |
|--------|-----------|
| Feed Posts | 3-4 per week |
| Stories | Daily |
| Reels | 1 per week |

---

### Engagement Strategy

Posting alone isn't enough. Budget time for genuine connection:

- **15-20 minutes daily** commenting meaningfully on posts from ideal clients and peers
- **Respond to every DM and comment** within 24 hours
- **Use Instagram Stories features:** polls, question boxes, sliders to start conversations
- **Go Live** once a week or bi-weekly—even just 10 minutes builds connection

---

## Lead Generation

### Discovery Calls

The simplest path to first clients: offer free 20-30 minute discovery calls.

**The goal isn't to "sell" but to:**

1. Understand their challenges deeply
2. Give them one insight or reframe they can use immediately
3. Invite them to continue working together if it's a genuine fit

**Promote across all channels with a clear call-to-action:**

> *"Ready to get unstuck? Book a free 30-minute clarity call. Link in bio."*

Use Calendly or similar for easy booking.

---

### Lead Magnet Ideas

A free resource builds your email list and establishes expertise. Choose one:

| Type | Example | Effort Level |
|------|---------|--------------|
| **PDF Guide** | "5 Questions to Ask Yourself When You're Feeling Stuck" | Low |
| **Checklist** | "The Weekly Reset: A Self-Care Checklist for Busy Women" | Low |
| **Self-Assessment Quiz** | "What's Really Holding You Back?" (use Typeform) | Medium |
| **Audio Meditation** | 10-minute guided visualization for clarity | Medium |
| **Video Training** | 15-minute teaching on your core methodology | Higher |

**Tip:** Start with a simple PDF. You can always create more elaborate resources later.

---

### Email Nurture Sequence

Once someone downloads your lead magnet, send 3-5 automated emails:

| Email | Purpose | Timing |
|-------|---------|--------|
| 1 | Deliver the freebie + warm introduction | Immediate |
| 2 | Share your story and why you do this work | Day 2 |
| 3 | Teach something valuable (expand on the freebie) | Day 4 |
| 4 | Share a client story or testimonial | Day 6 |
| 5 | Invite to book a discovery call | Day 8 |

---

## Launch Tactics

### Founding Client Offer

For your first 3-5 clients, consider offering:

- **Reduced rate** in exchange for testimonials and detailed feedback
- **"Founding Client" or "Beta" positioning** — frames it as exclusive, not discounted
- **Extended access** — perhaps an extra session or month of support

This removes the barrier of having no social proof yet while still valuing your work.

---

### Personal Outreach

The most effective strategy for first clients is often the least scalable: **direct, personal messages.**

Reach out to people you know or have connected with who might be a fit, or who might know someone.

**Template:**

> *"Hey [Name], I'm officially launching my coaching practice focused on helping [specific person] with [specific challenge]. I'm looking for 3 people who resonate with this. Would you or anyone you know be interested in a free call to explore if this could help? No pressure either way—just excited to share what I'm building."*

**Aim for:** 5-10 personal outreach messages per week

---

### Collaborative Visibility

Borrow other people's audiences:

| Tactic | How to Start |
|--------|--------------|
| **Podcast Guesting** | Search for podcasts in your niche. Many smaller shows actively need guests. Pitch yourself with a clear topic angle. |
| **Instagram Lives** | Partner with other coaches or complementary practitioners (therapists, nutritionists, yoga teachers) for joint Lives |
| **Newsletter Swaps** | Write a guest piece for someone else's email list; they write for yours |
| **Local Events** | Offer to speak at women's groups, professional organizations, wellness centers |

---

## Content Ideas

### High-Converting Post Types

| Content Type | Example Hook |
|-------------|--------------|
| **Origin Story** | "I became a coach because..." |
| **Before/After** | "My client came to me feeling X. After 3 months..." |
| **Myth-Busting** | "The biggest misconception about [your niche] is..." |
| **Question Post** | "What would change if you finally [desired outcome]?" |
| **Offer Post** | "I have 2 spots open for 1:1 coaching. Here's who it's for..." |
| **Vulnerable Share** | "I almost didn't post this, but..." |
| **Quick Tip** | "One thing I tell every client in our first session..." |
| **Reframe** | "What if the thing you're most afraid of is actually..." |

---

### Reel Ideas (Keep It Simple)

You don't need trending audio or complex editing. These formats work:

1. **Talking to camera** — 30 seconds on one key insight
2. **Text on screen** — A powerful quote or statement with you in background
3. **Day in my life** — Quick clips of your routine, workspace, practices
4. **Answer a question** — Respond to a common client question
5. **This vs. That** — "What society tells you vs. what's actually true"

---

### Sample Week (4-5 Hours Total Marketing Time)

| Day | Task | Time |

| **Monday** | Plan content for the week, create 2 posts | 60 min |
| **Tuesday** | Engage on Instagram, post Stories | 30 min |
| **Wednesday** | Create 1 Reel, post to feed | 45 min |
